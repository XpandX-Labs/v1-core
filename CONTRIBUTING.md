## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute, but here are a few suggestions if you're looking for a place to start:

1. **Opening an issue:** Before opening an issue, please make sure to check if there is already an existing one. If there is, please feel free to provide additional details, explanations, or examples as comments within the open issue instead of creating a duplicate. Opening issues to suggest changes to the development process is also welcomed. We value feedback and are open to suggestions!

2. **Resolving an issue:** You can resolve an issue by either demonstrating that it is not a problem or by fixing it through code changes, adding tests, and so on. Any pull request that addresses an issue should reference that specific issue.

3. **Reviewing open PRs:** You can contribute by reviewing open pull requests and providing comments, guidance on coding standards, suggestions for naming conventions, optimizations for gas usage, or proposing alternative design ideas. Your feedback on any open pull request is highly appreciated.
